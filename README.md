# **Quiz Box**

[Click here to view the live project](https://amrutha2103.github.io/quiz-box/)

Quiz Box is a training platform for programmers where you can improve your skills with fun exercises and test your knowledge with programmer quiz questions.

The quiz provides Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and you will have to read all the given answers and click over the correct answer. You can use "Next" button to go to next questions in the quiz.

Interactive quizzes are content where a user answers questions and is then given a specific result or score. The result is based on a calculation of the user's interactions and the answers they provided for each question.

### **Features to implement**

- When there is time, I would like to expand this quiz game to include timer within which the quiz has to be completed.
- I would also include an option to go back to the previous questions to edit the answer if the user wishes.
